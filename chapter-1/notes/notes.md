# Chapter 1 — Setting Up Python Environment

• Python = main language for cybersecurity scripting
• Used for networking, automation, scanning, and tool creation
• VS Code used as main editor
• Scripts run with: python3 <file>
• print() is used to display output
• input() gets user input
• Modules give Python superpowers:
    - socket → networking
    - os → file operations
    - sys → system info
• Simple projects in Chapter 1:
    - Hello World script
    - Input/Output program
    - Basic function script
    - Module import test
    - Tiny socket creation (intro only)
• Chapter 1 prepares environment — no hacking yet
• Must understand basics before building network tools
