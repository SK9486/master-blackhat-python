## 🟩 2. Key Concepts Explained (Kid-Friendly)

### 🔹 Python = Your Magic Toolbox
Python gives you tools to:

- talk to computers  
- send data  
- receive data  
- open network connections

You write and edit your code in **VS Code**.  
It helps you:

- organize your scripts  
- run them  
- debug them  
- manage hacker tools like a real pro
